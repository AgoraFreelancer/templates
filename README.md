# A Place For Templates 
This repo is a place for production developers to share landing page templates. The file are organized by, content management system > type of page > Example + template + readme. 

## Adding a new folder
When adding a new type of page file please include three files in it. 
  1.  An index.html file that is a fully rendered out page to act as an example of what a completed page of that type should look like. Since we don’t want to actually get traffic to these pages add: ‘<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW">’ to the top of the head. 
  2.  A template file with the naming convention, cms_type_template. So for example, iris_html_template.html. For more complex page types this can be a folder with modular assets in it. 
  3.  A readme file that explains how to use the template
